## nmslibR 1.0.1

* I commented the example(s) and test(s) related to the *dgCMatrix_2scipy_sparse* function [ *if (Sys.info()["sysname"] != 'Darwin')* ], because the *scipy-sparse* library on CRAN is not upgraded and the older version includes a bug (*TypeError : could not interpret data type*). This leads to an error on *Macintosh* Operating System ( *reference* : https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/5353 )
* I added links to the github repository (master repository, issues)


## nmslibR 1.0.0
